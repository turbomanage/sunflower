sunflower

Dart app which models the head of a sunflower using the golden angle. This version is modified from the Dart sample app at https://code.google.com/p/dart/source/browse/trunk/dart/samples/sunflower/ and features an extra slider to slightly adjust the value of phi. Also see my blog post on the golden ratio at http://turbomanage.wordpress.com/phi/.
